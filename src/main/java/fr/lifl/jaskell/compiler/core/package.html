This package contains all necessary definitions for core constructs
of the Jaskell language. 

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
During the parsing phase, the Jaskell compiler translates all high-level
syntactic constructs to a lowwer-level language named Jaskell-Core which
contains only a limited set of features. In particular, Jaskell-Core does not
allows nested declarations and all let constructs are lifted to the module
level.<p>
